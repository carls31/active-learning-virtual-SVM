abstract = {With the increasing of satellite missions, data fusion is growing attention in recent years. Pansharpening, which stands for panchromatic (PAN) sharpening, is a particular data fusion problem based on the enhancement of the spatial resolution of a multispectral image, thanks to the use of PAN data. This chapter is focused on pansharpening and, in particular, basic notions about (1) the main pansharpening approaches and their classification in three classes (i.e., multiresolution analysis, component substitution, and new generation methods), (2) the assessment procedures for pansharpened products, and (3) the extension of pansharpening to deal with the fusion of hyperspectral data (i.e., hyperspectral pansharpening).}
